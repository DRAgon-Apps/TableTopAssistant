# App Idea Thunderdome

### Factors to Consider

* **User Need**: Is there a demand for the type of app you're considering? It's crucial to identify a real problem that the app can solve or a need it can fulfill.
* **Market Research**: Look at existing apps in the market. How would your app differentiate from them? Try to find a unique selling proposition (USP) that makes your app stand out.
* **Feasibility**: How complex is the app idea? Do you have the necessary skills and resources to implement it? It's important to choose an idea that is challenging but still within your team's capabilities.
* **Time Frame**: Considering the timeline for the project, is your app idea feasible within the given time frame? Remember you can keep working on this app after the class ends, but you need an end product for unit 10.
* **Technical Constraints**: Consider what kind of technical resources your app would require. This includes backend infrastructure, external APIs, database management, etc.
* **Scalability**: Does your app have the potential to grow? An app idea that has room for future features and updates could be more appealing.

## App Idea #1: Cookbook App

- **What**: This app would allow users to store and view recipes for a variety of meals that they can prepare.

- **Who**: Anyone who enjoys cooking.

- **Why**: To have a specialized place to store cooking information that is readily availible and not jumbled in with other notetaking software (such as the notes app).

- **Challenges**: 
    - Could be seen as "just another notes app." 
    - We need to take into consideration how the app will be used WHILE cooking

## App Idea #2: BoardGame Helper

- **What**: This app allows user to access various features from boardgames such as coin flips, dice rolls, score tracking, timers, etc.

- **Who**: Boardgame enthusiast, everyday people who want to play a boardgame, people missing the physical parts of a boardgame.

- **Why**: We wanted to create an app that could be used on the side during boardgames. In the case of missing dice, broken counters, or just lacking the physical materials, users could open up the app to use it for dice rolling, keeping track of life or scores, flip coins to decide arguments, etc.

- **Challenges**: 
    - Make it visually appealing (Animations)
    - How to separate multiple scores in one screen automatically while working as buttons
    - Timers could be really easy or hard
